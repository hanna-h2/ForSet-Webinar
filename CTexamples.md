## H2 Examples of computational thinking in data stories 
---
Computational thinking is the thought process that comes before any computing technology - thought out by a human with an awareness of the power of automation. 

### H3 Example: “I would have killed her anyway”. Kloop’s investigation of femicide in Kyrgyzstan
---
[This story by Kloop](https://kloop.kg/blog/2021/01/28/femicide-in-kyrgyzstan/) won the 2021 Sigma Awards. It looks at the prevalence of femicide in Kyrgyzstan and is a good example of computational thinking.

It is a good example of decomposition and pattern recognition. Journalists at Kloop scraped 54,000 news articles from Kyrgyzstan's largest news agency. 

After developing a criteria of at least 12 indicators for what constituted femicide, they isolated around 80 words/sentences based on this criteria to help identify news and press releases which covered female murders (pattern recognition). 3,000 articles were analysed in detail, as a result 300 cases of femicide were identified from 2010-2020 and a database was created. 

Techniques used in this story include: Python, Scraping, data analysis in Python and Google Sheets, and visualisations made using Flourish. 

### H3 Example: Sport climbing to make its Olympic debut: Who are the athletes to watch out for?
---
[The second example](https://www.thatfigures.org/interactive/climbing-olympics-2021/) by Niels de Hoog is a scrollytelling feature explaining climbing at the Olympics and which athletes are likely to bode well during the tournament.   

This is a great example of using decomposition to solve problems, as well as abstract information relevant to telling the story. 

After the IFSC failed to provide data on which athletes had qualified for the tournament, Niels decided to scrape the data from the IFSC website. He scraped data on the athletes who qualified, their competition results and their rankings (abstraction). He then analysed the data in Python and used d3 to create simple visuals highlighting specific athletes.
